# Hospital Management System

### Overview
Developed a comprehensive Hospital Management System in Python as part of my academic project, designed to streamline hospital administrative tasks and improve healthcare data management. The system was built using basics of Object-Oriented Programming principles and with an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter for ease of use.
